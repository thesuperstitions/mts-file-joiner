The Northern Central Railroad (NCR) and York County Heritage (YCH) combine to create a simply an awesome trail.
Despite its proximity to Baltimore, this 41 miles long trail, (20 MD, 21 PA) follows nearly all rural terrain
(with much of it along side Gunpowder Falls River). The surface is fine crushed gravel and is in generally good
condition. The trail is also well shaded, so it is nice even on the hottest summer days.
